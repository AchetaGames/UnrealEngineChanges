# UnrealEngineChanges

A repository for tracking issues that need some attention&should be merged into the [UnrealEngine](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine)

Primary focus of this are Linux changes, but I am open to tracking other types of changes that improve the engine stability/speed in general.

## Contact

The Linux portion of this can be discussed in [Unreal Slackers](https://discord.gg/unreal-slackers) Discord channel in #Linux
